# Review --d
### My Project website in the course TDDD27, 2024.

"Review --d" will be a platform for students to review courses and share their experiences with other users. The main goal is for users to go in and read about other peoples reviews on different courses. Comments on each posts will help create discussion around the subject. With the implementation of a lot of different functions such as a like comment system the users will be able to see what students like and not. The user will also be able to have a friendslist making it able to see relevant posts and what they liked and so on. 

### Overview of project:

Features include: Profiles, profile page, main page with posts, login/register page, search bar, user authentication, login/logout, comments, descriptions, like system, upload profile image, theme (light/dark) and more.

Was planning on adding some API's to the project but im unsure at the moment which ones and what they would be used for. Could be a daily quote or motivation statement that would be displayed or something more complicated.

## Structure
The project will be developed as a fullstack application with a server side and a client side.

### Backend
The backend will be developed using NodeJS, Express framework and with MongoDB as the database. Theese files will all be located inside the server folder.

### Frontend
The frontend will be developed using React and Redux. For example icons from the React library MUI will be used. Theese files are all located inside the client folder.
